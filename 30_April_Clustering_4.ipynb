In some cases, a clustering algorithm may perform well in terms of separating the different classes into distinct clusters, but may not be able to capture all of the variations within each class.

In this case, the algorithm may achieve high homogeneity because each cluster contains mostly images of a single class. However, some images of each animal species may be grouped with other animal species, resulting in low completeness. For instance, some images of cats may be grouped with rabbits because they have similar colors or textures.

In such cases, other clustering evaluation metrics may be more appropriate.\n",
